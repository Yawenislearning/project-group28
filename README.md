## Project Drescription:
We assume that our apartment lease is ending at the end of the year, and we need to find a new apartment. There are a lot of criteria we can use to help find a neighborhood youâ€™d like to live in. One thing you care a lot about is a quiet neighborhood with a lot of greenery. 
So we use NYC_TREE and NYC_311_COMPLAINT to simulate green and quiet neighborhood.
