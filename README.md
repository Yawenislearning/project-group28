## Project Drescription:
We assume that our apartment lease is ending at the end of the year, and we need to find a new apartment. There are a lot of criteria we can use to help find a neighborhood you’d like to live in. One thing you care a lot about is a quiet neighborhood with a lot of greenery. 
So we use NYC_TREE and NYC_311_COMPLAINT to simulate green and quiet neighborhood.

## Report Content:
Part 1: download and clean data 

Part 2: store data in postgresql

Part 4: visualize the query data

What's more: extra part--'create a new table and query' is write seperately in Part1,2,3
